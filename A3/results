Schematic knowledge ,  then ,  is a necessary source of reference in use whereby linguistic symbols are converted into indices in the process of interpretation .  But we should note , too , that language development itself , the acquisition of knowledge of symbolic meanings , is <<head>>activated<<head>> by the need to extend schematic knowledge so as to cope more effectively with the social environment . We learn language in order to manage our affairs in the world we find ourselves in .  Language is the means of initiation into the conventions of conceptualization and communication which define particular cultures .  </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.01372090" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.01372090" senseid="38201"/><context>Formal education extends this process by providing guidance into different ways of conceiving of the world and different ways of conveying these concepts in modes of description ,  argument ,  and so on .  Particular subjects on the curriculum can be seen as different sub - cultures in which reality is variously reformulated .  But if it is the case that language learning is activated by the socio - cultural purpose of schematic extension , that we learn language in order to get a better grasp of the world so that we can turn it to our advantage , then it would seem to follow that a central problem in the teaching of a foreign language lies in the provision of some comparable <<head>>activating<<head>> purpose . In other words ,  we need to identify areas of schematic knowledge which the learners will accept as independently relevant and worth acquiring so that the learning of the language is seen as the necessary means to a desired end .  If this is so ,  the first question to be asked in designing a language course should not be What language do we need to teach ?  but rather What do we need to teach that will stimulate the learning of language ?  </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.02014009" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.02014009" senseid="38202"/><context>There is controversy over whether the carrier also transports a proton  ( or pH - changing anion )  .  Here we show that the carrier generates an alkalinization outside and an acidification inside glial cells ,  and transports anions out of the cells ,  suggesting that there is a carrier cycle in which two Na +  accompany each glutamate anion into the cell ,  while one K +  and one OH  -    ( or HCO )  are transported out .  This stoichiometry predicts a minimum Glu o of 0.6M normally ( tonically <<head>>activating<<head>> presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic NMDA receptors ) , and 370M during brain anoxia ( high enough to kill neurons ) . Transport of OH  -   /HCO on the uptake carrier generates significant pH changes ,  and may provide a mechanism for neuron - glial interaction .  Glutamate uptake was monitored electrically in salamander retinal glia ,  which have uptake like that in mammalian glia and neurons but have no glutamate - gated ion channels .  </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.02014015" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.02014015" senseid="38202"/><context>Activating uptake ,  by hyperpolarizing in the presence of external glutamate ,  led to the pH o  going alkaline  ( Fig. 1 a  )  .

The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <<head>>activate<<head>> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .  </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.02015290" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.02015290" senseid="38202"/><context>When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to <<head>>activate<<head>> adequate numbers of NMDA receptors . ( It follows that there can be little activation of NMDA receptors by ambient or spontaneously released L - glutamate ,  otherwise LTP would be induced by depolarization alone .  )  Because the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation is prevented by a variety of NMDA antagonists ,  including those which act at the receptor  ( such as 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoate  ( AP5 )  )  ,  in the channel  ( for example ,  MK - 801  ( ref .  25 )  )  and at the allosteric glycine site  ( for example ,  7 - chlorokynurenic acid )  ,  it is clear that activation of these receptors is an essential trigger for the process .  </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.02015368" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.02015368" senseid="38202"/><context>There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,  indicating that kinase activity outlasts the initial induction signal .  But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate .  For example , it has been suggested that constitutively <<head>>activated<<head>> PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not. </context></instance><instance id="activate.v.bnc.02015487" docsrc="BNC"><answer instance="activate.v.bnc.02015487" senseid="38201"/><context>Demonstration of the properties of cooperativity ,  input specificity and associativity .

Long - lasting potentiation can also be induced by transient exposure of hippocampal synapses to a variety of chemical agents ,  including Ca 2+166  ,  arachidonic acid ,  the metabotropic glutamate receptor  ( mGluR )  agonist aminocyclopentane - 1S,3R - dicarboxylate  ( 1S,3R - ACPD )  ,  the K +  channel blocker ,  tetraethylammonium  ( TEA )  and the G - protein activator NaF/AlCl 3  .  Chemically - induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP ( that is , saturation of one prevents induction of the other ) , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade <<head>>activated<<head>> by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor .

These dynamic changes in spatial expression are identical to those observed with Hox - B1  ,  therefore the combination of Hox  genes expressed in r4  ( ref .  10 )  is reproduced in r2 upon exposure to retinoic acid .  The Hox - B1 experiments showed that a marker for r5 ( expression in neural cell bodies ) was <<head>>activated<<head>> in r3 and we wanted to examine whether there were other changes to segmental expression in r3 . We have used a line of transgenic mice that accurately reveals the normal spatial and temporal patterns of Krox - 20  expression in r3 and r5  ( Fig. 3a - e  ;  ref .  23 )  .
