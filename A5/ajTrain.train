Do you know what it is ,  and where I can get one ?  We suspect you had seen the Terrex Autospade ,  which is made by Wolf Tools .  It is quite a hefty spade , with bicycle - type handlebars and a sprung lever at the rear , which you step on to <head>activate</head> it . Used correctly ,  you should n't have to bend your back during general digging ,  although it wo n't lift out the soil and put in a barrow if you need to move it !  If gardening tends to give you backache ,  remember to take plenty of rest periods during the day ,  and never try to lift more than you can easily cope with .

This common knowledge of shared experience and conventionally sanctioned reality can be called schematic  knowledge :  it is the knowledge which is acquired as a condition of entry into a particular culture or sub - culture .   Schematic knowledge ,  then ,  is a necessary source of reference in use whereby linguistic symbols are converted into indices in the process of interpretation .  But we should note , too , that language development itself , the acquisition of knowledge of symbolic meanings , is <head>activated</head> by the need to extend schematic knowledge so as to cope more effectively with the social environment . We learn language in order to manage our affairs in the world we find ourselves in .  Language is the means of initiation into the conventions of conceptualization and communication which define particular cultures .

Formal education extends this process by providing guidance into different ways of conceiving of the world and different ways of conveying these concepts in modes of description ,  argument ,  and so on .  Particular subjects on the curriculum can be seen as different sub - cultures in which reality is variously reformulated .  But if it is the case that language learning is activated by the socio - cultural purpose of schematic extension , that we learn language in order to get a better grasp of the world so that we can turn it to our advantage , then it would seem to follow that a central problem in the teaching of a foreign language lies in the provision of some comparable <head>activating</head> purpose . In other words ,  we need to identify areas of schematic knowledge which the learners will accept as independently relevant and worth acquiring so that the learning of the language is seen as the necessary means to a desired end .  If this is so ,  the first question to be asked in designing a language course should not be What language do we need to teach ?  but rather What do we need to teach that will stimulate the learning of language ?

There is controversy over whether the carrier also transports a proton  ( or pH - changing anion )  .  Here we show that the carrier generates an alkalinization outside and an acidification inside glial cells ,  and transports anions out of the cells ,  suggesting that there is a carrier cycle in which two Na +  accompany each glutamate anion into the cell ,  while one K +  and one OH  -    ( or HCO )  are transported out .  This stoichiometry predicts a minimum Glu o of 0.6M normally ( tonically <head>activating</head> presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic NMDA receptors ) , and 370M during brain anoxia ( high enough to kill neurons ) . Transport of OH  -   /HCO on the uptake carrier generates significant pH changes ,  and may provide a mechanism for neuron - glial interaction .  Glutamate uptake was monitored electrically in salamander retinal glia ,  which have uptake like that in mammalian glia and neurons but have no glutamate - gated ion channels .

Activating uptake ,  by hyperpolarizing in the presence of external glutamate ,  led to the pH o  going alkaline  ( Fig. 1 a  )  .  Omitting external glutamate  ( Fig. 1 a  )  or sodium  ( Fig. 1 b  )  abolished this pH o  change ,  as would be expected if it were produced by glutamate uptake .  Hyperpolarizing to more negative potentials , to activate more uptake , generated larger H + o changes ( Fig. 1 c ) which were proportional to the uptake current <head>activated</head> ( Fig. 1 d ) . D - Aspartate ,  a non - metabolized analogue of L - glutamate and D - aspartate  ( Fig. 1 f  )  ,  showing that glutamate metabolism does not cause the pH o  change .

Long - term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is the primary experimental model for investigating the synaptic basis of learning and memory in vertebrates .  The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <head>activate</head> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .

When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to <head>activate</head> adequate numbers of NMDA receptors . ( It follows that there can be little activation of NMDA receptors by ambient or spontaneously released L - glutamate ,  otherwise LTP would be induced by depolarization alone .  )  Because the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation is prevented by a variety of NMDA antagonists ,  including those which act at the receptor  ( such as 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoate  ( AP5 )  )  ,  in the channel  ( for example ,  MK - 801  ( ref .  25 )  )  and at the allosteric glycine site  ( for example ,  7 - chlorokynurenic acid )  ,  it is clear that activation of these receptors is an essential trigger for the process .

There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,  indicating that kinase activity outlasts the initial induction signal .  But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate .  For example , it has been suggested that constitutively <head>activated</head> PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not.

The effect is small ,  develops gradually ,  is blocked by Ca 2+  channel antagonists ,  and requires stronger tetanic stimulation for its induction than is needed for NMDA receptor - dependent LTP .  Long - lasting potentiation can also be induced by transient exposure of hippocampal synapses to a variety of chemical agents ,  including Ca 2+166  ,  arachidonic acid ,  the metabotropic glutamate receptor  ( mGluR )  agonist aminocyclopentane - 1S,3R - dicarboxylate  ( 1S,3R - ACPD )  ,  the K +  channel blocker ,  tetraethylammonium  ( TEA )  and the G - protein activator NaF/AlCl 3  .  Chemically - induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP ( that is , saturation of one prevents induction of the other ) , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade <head>activated</head> by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor . BOX 2 The role of amino - acid receptors in the induction of LTP This e.p.s.p .  can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists ,  such as 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2,3 - dione  ( CNQX )  ,  and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor - mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors  -   amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate  ( AMPA )  .

The Hox - B1/lacZ transgene , like the endogenous gene , is initially <head>activated</head> in a broad domain at preheadfold stages , with an anterior limit mapping to the future r3/4 boundary . There is a progressive restriction of the anterior domain of expression which is limited to rhombomere 4 in the hindbrain by 9.5 d.p.c .  ( Fig.1 a - d  )  .

Between 9.09.5d.p.c .  ,  these patterns becomes refined with a progressive restriction leading to the appearance of stripes of expression in r2 and r4 and a stream of crest cells migrating from each  ( Fig. 1 i '  )  .  These dynamic changes in spatial expression are identical to those observed with Hox - B1  ,  therefore the combination of Hox  genes expressed in r4  ( ref .  10 )  is reproduced in r2 upon exposure to retinoic acid .  The Hox - B1 experiments showed that a marker for r5 ( expression in neural cell bodies ) was <head>activated</head> in r3 and we wanted to examine whether there were other changes to segmental expression in r3 . We have used a line of transgenic mice that accurately reveals the normal spatial and temporal patterns of Krox - 20  expression in r3 and r5  ( Fig. 3a - e  ;  ref .  23 )  .  In initial stages ,  as reported for both Xenopus  and mouse embryos treated with retinoic acid ,  we find that although there is a clearly defined segment in the r3 position ,  the r3 stripe of Krox - 20  expression is absent .

Scobie is surely right when ,  with regard to Let Us Compare Mythologies  he says that the title seems to indicate that Cohen himself regarded the religious sense as the primary one  which in The Spice - Box Of Earth  becomes completely explicit and even urgent .  The ceremony of the havdalah  ,  the bidding adieu to the Sabbath ,  centres on the spice - box and the candle .  The blessing itself is made over a cup of wine in honour of the day ( Blessed art Thou , O Lord our God , King of the universe , who createst divers kinds of spices ) which <head>adds</head> to the light of the Sabbath , symbolised by the candle , offering a fragrance and a beauty all its own . Leonard extends this sense here in this book  to those who will read and ponder .  The book was offered with a sharp recollection of his own family ,  not only regarding his  father 's  absence of many years  ( whose duty it was ,  formally ,  to say the prayer )  ,  but in the dedication of the book ,  another link with the past broken ,  another mainstay ,  albeit distant ,  removed :  This book is dedicated to the memory of my grandmother Mrs Lyon Cohen ,  and to the memory of my grandfather Rabbi Solomon Klinitsky .

What this <head>adds</head> up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no difference to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

But when you have a situation where youngsters of 12 or 13  and in some cases even younger  who may only have won a couple of matches ,  are being offered 500,000 guarantees to sign up with one of the management companies before they are snapped up by one of the rival agents ,  the potential for long term damage is enormous .  This year ,  in prize money alone ,  there is well over 100m available for professional players round the world ,  including team events such as The David Cup and The Federation Cup .  And that is before you start taking into consideration commercial endorsements and appearance money which , at a conservative guess must <head>add</head> at least another 3040m . Yet all we seem to have heard ,  either from a few of the more militant leading players or their representatives in recent months ,  has been the cry We want more .  If it is not the Women 's  Tennis Association ,  spurred on by the vocal support of Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles demanding equal prize money at Wimbledon and the French ,  then it is the voices on the men 's  side who want prize money for the top tier of their tournaments doubled to 2m .

We have never before been able to run more than one senior men 's  squad ,  yet now ,  thanks to Cellnet 's  backing ,  we will have three to back the elite Davis Cup squad .  Each offers slightly different and more appropriate benefits to the players ,  so that the individuals have a secure platform from which we hope they will make serious bids for international success .  A good example of the sort of player who should be a great beneficiary of this scheme is James Lenton a tremendously hard worker who has struggled financially and once even had to quit to resort to coaching , Lewis <head>added</head> .

But by 1985 the sad reality had to be faced that  so far as InterCity was concerned  the market had changed ,  probably for ever .  Business people  no longer prepared to spend five hours or more on a daytime Euston - Glasgow journey  had switched to air ,  while leisure travellers had been lured away by the bargain - priced coaches .  To offset the loss of Glasgow business , extra stops were <head>added</head> to the daytime service which was revamped to serve towns such as Warrington , Wigan , Lancaster , Oxenholme and Penrith which offered greater business prospects . Only the Royal Scot  remained as a viable Euston - Glasgow train but with a schedule fifteen minutes slower than the five - hour norm established in the 1974 timetable .  At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .

Indeed ,  for a time it enabled the service to become an all HST operation so that some places actually had a better service .  There were four major East Coast developments in the 1980s :  the significant increase in HST productivity so that sets could be more extensively deployed to provide service to Inverness ,  Glasgow Queen Street ,  Hull and Cleethorpes ;  electrification of the route from Hitchin to Leeds with only minor interference to train services ;  introduction of a new track - maintenance strategy and transfer of overnight Anglo - Scottish sleeping - car services to the West Coast main line .  Although the original HST plans provided for two daily return journeys between King 's Cross and Aberdeen , by judicious programming of the sets ( plus some extra sets transferred from the Western region ) it was possible to <head>add</head> on some extra trips to existing rosters . This enabled InterCity to introduce additional HSTs to Aberdeen ,  a pair of business services to Hull and Cleethorpes and an entirely new service The Highland Chieftain  between King 's  Cross and Inverness with a journey time of seven hours .  Because of the need to refuel the two power cars ,  the practical operating range of an HST set is about 1,100 miles after which the unit must visit the depot to replenish its tanks .

The Hastings 20m scheme was celebrated by a successful Gala Day on 27 April when unlimited travel over the line for only 1 was available and more formally on 6 May when the Queen Mother  ( Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports )  travelled over the line in the Royal Train .

Steam - heated hauled stock was also eradicated ,  and the response was the reclassification of more Class 31/4s and 47/4s ,  plus the first Class 37/4s .  Longer - term planning forced BR to embark upon life - extension programmes for several locomotive types expected to be needed until well into the 1990s ,  although they were halted in 1989 before being completed .  English Electric Class 37s in particular were subjected to near - total rebuilds , involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator , regeared CP7 bogies , and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit , electric - heat generator , or ballast weights <head>added</head> to provide extra adhesion for particular freight work . Thus ,  one standard locomotive design evolved into six specialist types .  Many Brush - built Class 31s were equipped with ETH generators and given a major body overhaul ,  while some Class 47s were similarly treated .

It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,  which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .  A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can <head>add</head> interest and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example :  the swift change from the grand dvelopp   la seconde  which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque  when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's  eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake  ;  it is Odile 's  triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's  heart .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes <head>add</head> a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .

The flowers of the hop plant <head>add</head> bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process . As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also add sugars ,  such as glucose or cereal syrup ,  to encourage a strong fermentation .

They now grow Whitbread Goldings Variety ,  developed to be more resistant to wilt than the traditional East Kent type .  After years of knockabout abuse in this paper ,  lets give two muted cheers for Whitbread and their hops .  Bob uses hops in the classic British bitter fashion : Fuggles for bitterness and Goldings , <head>added</head> late in the boil , for aroma . He gets his Fuggles from a leading grower named Tony Redsell at the splendidly - named Mockbeggar Farm near Faversham .  Bob has a further good reason for preferring whole hops :  pesticides .

Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .  Pellets may also be stabilised by the inclusion of vitamin C  ( ascorbic acid )  to reduce oxidation .  Calcium and magnesium salts may then be <head>added</head> to partly catalyse conversion of a acids so pre - empting the boiling reactions . Losses of a  acid may be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent by these means .  Even greater efficiency of a  acid utilisation is obtained using chemical extracts of hops .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to produce bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be <head>added</head> towards the end of the boil or even afterwards . Near 100 per cent utilisation of the hop a  acid is possible by this process .  Flavours may also be separated in the hop extract and can be fractionated .

Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be produced .  Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being <head>added</head> from whole hops or , more likely , from a dirty hand . Because of the degree of processing involved ,  hop extracts are not necessarily cheaper than using whole hops .  Per unit of bitterness they are roughly as costly .

There is no such decline with extracts .  Within 30 years the brewing industry has gone from a cottage industry to high tech .  English Hops began their development of hop oils by looking at the dry hopping end of the brewing process , when a handful of whole or pellet hops are <head>added</head> to casks of beer . There can be problems of infection at this stage ,  David Gardner said .  With hop oils you can get the best from the hops ,  the essential oils and essences that can replicate the aroma and bitterness of two such disparate varieties as a Fuggle and a Golding .

Do not worry that the first solution will actually make the wood darker .  It is applied to turn the wood into an alkaline condition ,  so that when the B or No. 2 solution is applied ,  it will liberate oxygen ,  thus bleaching the wood .

If the wood is very badly stained ,  it may require two applications of bleach .

Compare Dostoevsky 's  attempt ,  frustrated by the good angel of his genius ,  to explain Raskolnikov 's  motive for his crime .  In the novel itself ,  where we might expect Marmeladov to speak of solace ,  respite ,  forgetting ,  companionship ,  he grasps the paradox that he drinks because he is in search of suffering ,  of tears and tribulation .  And , he <head>adds</head> , I have found them . This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .  Moreover ,  as always in Dostoevsky ,  the search for suffering refuses to settle into coherent masochistic focus .

The one is the passive and the other the active form of a single human truth ,  as Dostoevsky sees it and realizes it fictionally .  The singleness of this truth is what I called the marriage of the Drunks  project and the Confession project in Crime and Punishment  .  The novelist is now of course in middle age , but right back in his teens he wrote to his brother Man is a mystery , <head>adding</head> that a lifetime spent trying to unravel the mystery would not be wasted . On its own this reads like a perfectly ordinary youthful Europeanized sententious romantic flourish .  But now comes the idiosyncratic twist .

And not so Svidrigailov and Raskolnikov ,  both hyperconscious men ,  and both  ( as we shall see )  linked by their condition to the city which Peter the Great pondered over and then ordered to be built .  Svidrigailov 's  answer ,  when Raskolnikov asks him Shy do n't you see a doctor ?  is that he does n't need to be told he 's  ill .  It does n't follow that he knows what the matter is honestly , though , I do n't know what 's wrong with me , he <head>adds</head> . He has n't got the underground man 's  bodiless analytic clarity .  He only knows that he needs air and ca n't get it ;  a state evinced by  his terminal boredom ,  and by single sovereign descriptive strokes like the fact that his eyes are a little too blue leaving the reader to imagine a pair of empty summer - sky souls ,  very bright and staring in pain .

Nevertheless his crime ,  like the tawdry footloose elimination of Shatov ,  springs from unsteadiness  (  shatost )   .  The word appears twice in Dostoevsky 's  letter to Katkov outlining Crime and Punishment  ,  in the phrase unsteadiness of ideas  which is natural since a drama of reflection is about to unfold :  thinking is Raskolnikov 's  work ,  as he tells the maid Nastasya .

And what of the document itself ?

That the written statement and its publication <head>add</head> up to a true Dostoevsky confession , to repentance and acceptance of suffering , to a wonderful podvig in Tikhon 's words , is one possibility among many .

If we take wanting everybody to look at him as the real reason ,  then the case of Stavrogin is  ( in the lawyer 's  phrase )  on all fours with that of the underground man 's  indecent exposure of consciousness .  However ,  I invite nobody into my soul he declares ,  as if to banish the exhibitionist thought.44 And then if the search for suffering is allowed to eclipse the rest ,  we are back with Marmeladov squinnying into the bottom of his vodka jug ;  whereas Stavrogin saying he wants to forgive himself might be Raskolnikov pondering retrospectively ,  selfcritically ,  on his admission of guilt at the police station .  To Marmeladov , Raskolnikov , and the underground man , I now <head>add</head> Svidrigailov , because the chief enormity which is being confessed , or merely admitted to , or flaunted , or feigned , binds Stavrogin to the America - minded debauchee no less tightly than does the boredom theme of the At Tikhon 's chapter . As with the highly misleading phrase Stavrogin 's  Confession ,  critics and commentators behave as if they had got into a huddle .  Everybody ,  including the present Soviet editor ,  talks about Stavrogin 's  forcing or rape of a young girl .

Laser beams consist of photons which ,  though small by atomic standards ,  have a cumulative inertial effect ,  Dr Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado ,  who heads one research group ,  says that cooling an atom with a laser beam is like trying to slow down movement of a heavy object by bombarding it with ping - pong balls .  In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ;  the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms .  Otherwise the effect is to <head>add</head> heat energy rather than remove it . What Wieman has done  as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record  is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .  Not only has the essential large vacuum cell been reduced to a small glass cell ,  but Wieman has also been able to replace gas lasers with solid state devices .

Traffic message control  ( TMC )  ,  under development as one of the European Drive projects ,  may bring RDS a little nearer to Carfax .  This is seen as using RDS as a data channel of very limited capacity in conjunction with a speech synthesis chip or possibly some form of printer in the car  ( it could provide automatic translation when travelling abroad )  as a means of sending traffic telegrams to cars without interrupting the radio programmes .  But TMC seems bound to <head>add</head> much extra intricacy to the already complicated RDS receiver . D Kopitz  ( EBU )  in discussing  development of TMC admits that :  The TMC device will probably be too complex to permit its incorporation within a standard car radio case .  It will also require it own RF tuner  ( VHF )  to permit the car radio listener a free choice of listening entertainment ,  without obligation to tune to the particular programme service which carries TMC information .

A key text is his early essay ,  Structure ,  Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences ,  which concludes that there are two possible interpretations of interpretation :  The one seeks to decipher ,  dreams of deciphering a truth or an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign ,  and which lives the necessity of interpretation as an exile .  The other ,  which is no longer turned toward the origin ,  affirms play and tries to pass beyond man and humanism . Derrida says that these two interpretations are absolutely irreconcilable , even though , he <head>adds</head> in his gnomic fashion , we reconcile them in an obscure economy . It is his second interpretation ,  deriving substantially from Nietzsche ,  that has become dominant in deconstruction as popularly understood ,  where all meaning is turned into play .  And it is this approach which leads to denunciation of Derrida as a  nihilist ;  in Frederick Crews 's  words ,  an intellectual nihilist ,  though a learned and exuberant one .

Raymond Tallis expands the charge ,  towards the end of his long negative analysis of Derrida 's  thought :  His is in some ways a tragic case :  a man of immense talent and massive erudition ,  gifted with profound insights ,  who could not say the things he most wanted to say but who ,  nevertheless ,  has gone on to say them .  The publicity his ideas have attracted has only deepened the tragedy : the bad influence of those he has himself influenced has <head>added</head> frivolity to the obscurity Derrida 's  admirers ,  and perhaps some disinterested observers ,  would reject such charges as based on misunderstandings of his work .

To identify English as peculiarly problematical should not weaken the general defence of humane values in education ,  and may in the longer run help to strengthen them .  A successful military campaign may require giving up some  tactically untenable territory .

In the wake of the MacCabe affair in 1981 ,  an editorial in the Times Higher Education Supplement  said that a fissiparous discipline such as English had a number of hard choices in front of it :  it could become even more pluralistic and diffuse ,  with accompanying pedagogic problems ;  it could repressively impose one favoured approach ;  or it could split .  Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .

The poem ,  we might say ,  is in two minds about itself and its own meaning .   But that is not the whole story .  For Pound undoubtedly made the poem more obscure by asking for the excision of some transitional and bridging passages where the language was not at full pressure , but on the other hand he caused to be removed some extended sections which , being plainly extraneous , could only have <head>added</head> to readers ' bafflement . Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot .  As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear ,  he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense ,  one who was concerned for public life ,  and believed  ( like activists of the Left )  that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ;  whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's  political pronouncements ,  even when he was most engag  as editor of True Criterion  ,  revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .

The New Zealanders ,  appropriately garbed in funereal black ,  arrive next week to scatter the ashes .  On and off the field the national game of the Land of Song is in a discordant mess .  Losing was one thing but to lose as spinelessly as the Welsh XV did to Bridgend on Saturday was to <head>add</head> insult to severely injured pride . In all honesty we should have won by at least 15 points ,  Brian Nicholas ,  the Bridgend coach ,  said .  As if 24 - 17 and derisive chants of Easy ,  easy were not bad enough ,  this humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season  a week earlier Pontypool had given them a 35 - 6 going - over  and were short of at least half - a - dozen first - choice players .

Yet what pleased the Bath coach Jack Rowell more than the cold facts and figures was that his team had come to terms with Neath 's  unique style of total rugby .  That was the greatest triumph .  The only way forward for British rugby is to play that standard of game every week , he <head>added</head> . Playing regularly in south Wales has helped us to go places and 10 years on it 's  nice to crown it with a win like this .  Now we must look to the next stage of development .

Last night ,  the East German Foreign Ministry issued a statement attacking the attitude of the refugees :  Some East German citizens will justifiably ask why we let these people emigrate to West Germany via East Germany ,  even though they had grossly violated our laws ,  said the statement read as the main television news item .  Among these people there are anti - social elements who have a bad attitude to work and also to normal living conditions .  Earlier , East Germany had announced the solution as a humanitarian act by the government , <head>adding</head> that it hoped Bonn in future would run its embassies in normal manner according to international usage . West Germany had expected around 5,000 refugees  including 809 from Warsaw ,  who arrived in Helmstedt  but more kept pouring from the special trains .  Hundreds had evidently gone straight to the station in Prague without contacting the embassy .

But every sign now is that to shortages , inflation and a runaway budget deficit must be <head>added</head> serious shortfalls in output of coal , oil and nuclear energy . The troubles of the nuclear industry in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 are well known :  a slowdown or halt to construction of new plants ,  plus the closedown earlier this year of the nuclear power station near Erevan in Armenia because of safety worries after last December 's  earthquake .  Now ,  in the space of four days ,  two key ministers have given bleak warnings over the state of affairs in both the oil and coal industries ,  the largest of their kind in the world .

Chief executive John Wyatt said he was still hopeful the target of 78 house sales by the end of the year would be achieved ,  with 41 sold so far .

Specialised materials ,  which Tootal promised would be an engine of growth ,  has yet to prove its worth ,  though continued heavy investment could be blamed for a 40 per cent fall in profits .  The fabrics side was held back by a decline in demand for batiks in West Africa .  Conventional wisdom is that Tootal will <head>add</head> management expertise to Coats , but on the evidence of the first half neither is skilled at controlling working capital . Tootal 's  is around 35 per cent higher than the group would like ,  and an interest charge that should be declining was a fifth higher than last year .  Pre - tax profits this year will be lower than last year 's  42.3m and the shares ,  which slipped 1.5p to 127p ,  are only being held up by the Coats offer ,  worth 133p .

The Assembly ,  of 17 seats ,  has five appointed members ,  six directly - elected and six indirectly - elected members .  Hong Kong 's  Legislative Council as yet has no directly - elected seats .  The proposals to increase the number of seats to 23 , likely to be made later this year , will not change the balance of power in the Council : two seats each will be <head>added</head> to appointed , directly - and indirectly - elected categories . Nevertheless ,  local newspaper reports say Peking is concerned that this could further fuel calls for greater democracy in Hong Kong ,  where the British government now seems more committed to increasing the pace of political reform .  Despite the democratic element in government ,  however ,  the liberal - leaning elected members of the Assembly have little power ,  because the conservatives dominate the body through appointed indirectly - elected seats .

Grim as events might seem ,  Britain could not contemplate a massive new immigration commitment which could more than double the ethnic minority population of the United Kingdom .

The last official census was in 1932 ,  when France was still exercising its League of Nations mandate for Lebanon in neo - colonial fashion .  It showed that the Maronites constituted 29 per cent of the population  ( 229,378 )  ,  the Sunnis 22 per cent  ( 175,925 )  and the Shias 19 per cent  ( 154,208 )  .  When the Maronites were <head>added</head> to other Christian groups ( Greek Catholics , Greek Orthodox , Armenians and others ) , the Christians formed 52 per cent of the population . Together with the Druze ,  the Sunnis and Shias comprised a Muslim total of 48 per cent .  The French were not blind to the bitterness of many Muslims in Lebanon ,  especially the Sunnis ,  who under Turkish rule had held a privileged position .

This uncertainty was reflected in unprecedented levels of <head>argument</head> within the government , conducted in the full glare of public attention .

The revival of the campaign for Scottish devolution  indeed ,  for Scottish nationalism ,  as shown in Jim Sillars '  by - election victory in Govan  was a notable feature of the later phase of Mrs Thatcher 's  regime .  Here and elsewhere ,  the government strove to identify itself with new themes .  In particular , the green <head>argument</head> advanced by environmentalists , fanned by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 Euro - elections , suggested that the message of Thatcherite consumption and wealth creation failed to mesh with wider concerns for the quality of life . The rise of green issues ,  indeed ,  was more naturally appealing to Labour or Alliance politicians ,  and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to Thatcherism that British society could release .  It led to Nicholas Ridley 's  removal from the Environment department in July 1989 ,  in favour of the notoriously wet Chris Patten .

He  dedicated this formidable intellect to eradicating nonsense from the world ,  especially nonsense in divinity ,  which was a world where in those days he could find plenty of targets for his scorn .

Since most Christian teachers are kind persons who prefer to avoid controversy when they can , and doodle anxiously during fierce <head>argument</head> at meetings , things tended to go the way of Bethune - Baker ; partly because he was devastating , and partly because often he was devastatingly right .
