Do you know what it is ,  and where I can get one ?  We suspect you had seen the Terrex Autospade ,  which is made by Wolf Tools .  It is quite a hefty spade , with bicycle - type handlebars and a sprung lever at the rear , which you step on to <head>activate</head> it . Used correctly ,  you should n't have to bend your back during general digging ,  although it wo n't lift out the soil and put in a barrow if you need to move it !  If gardening tends to give you backache ,  remember to take plenty of rest periods during the day ,  and never try to lift more than you can easily cope with .

This common knowledge of shared experience and conventionally sanctioned reality can be called schematic  knowledge :  it is the knowledge which is acquired as a condition of entry into a particular culture or sub - culture .   Schematic knowledge ,  then ,  is a necessary source of reference in use whereby linguistic symbols are converted into indices in the process of interpretation .  But we should note , too , that language development itself , the acquisition of knowledge of symbolic meanings , is <head>activated</head> by the need to extend schematic knowledge so as to cope more effectively with the social environment . We learn language in order to manage our affairs in the world we find ourselves in .  Language is the means of initiation into the conventions of conceptualization and communication which define particular cultures .

Formal education extends this process by providing guidance into different ways of conceiving of the world and different ways of conveying these concepts in modes of description ,  argument ,  and so on .  Particular subjects on the curriculum can be seen as different sub - cultures in which reality is variously reformulated .  But if it is the case that language learning is activated by the socio - cultural purpose of schematic extension , that we learn language in order to get a better grasp of the world so that we can turn it to our advantage , then it would seem to follow that a central problem in the teaching of a foreign language lies in the provision of some comparable <head>activating</head> purpose . In other words ,  we need to identify areas of schematic knowledge which the learners will accept as independently relevant and worth acquiring so that the learning of the language is seen as the necessary means to a desired end .  If this is so ,  the first question to be asked in designing a language course should not be What language do we need to teach ?  but rather What do we need to teach that will stimulate the learning of language ?

Rightly or wrongly ,  the investing public ,  and others ,  do not see going concern qualifications as purely objective assessments of the distribution of future cash flows designed to aid investors in their portfolio choice .  They see them as having wider connotations ,  which may include casting doubt on both management competence and the financial statements '  integrity .  For these reasons , client managements are unlikely to welcome a going concern qualification , and their concerns may well be reinforced if such a qualification restricts management freedom of action , possibly by allowing debt covenants to be <head>activated</head> , restricting the freedom to pay dividends , and so on . It may well be that risk - taking companies are managed by risk - taking individuals with powerful personalities .  Such individuals are likely to react adversely to anything they perceive as criticism of either their company or themselves ,  and may react by penalising the auditor by directing lucrative consultancy contracts elsewhere or even changing auditors .

On the basis of extensive research in a number of congregations in the United States ,  Peter Wagner has postulated an estimate of ten per cent who are either effectively or potentially gifted as evangelists .  If this percentage potential could be considered to hold true outside the USA ,  we would certainly have to ask of the great majority of congregations ,  What has happened to your ten per cent ?  If it exists at all , their efforts must be going unrecognised , or have been rendered inoperative , or were never <head>activated</head> in the first place . The fact that there is little or no evidence that a gift is operating does not necessarily mean ,  however ,  that it is not present .  Gifts can atrophy .

From a sort of mobile console a thin tube containing a fibre - optic light and a wire - cutter is uncoiled and inserted into the penis .

They are attached to an alarm and when the child wets during the night the circuit is connected which <head>activates</head> the alarm . The child should get up ,  go to the lavatory to finish urinating ,  and then with the help of the parents change the bed and reset the alarm .  The rationale for the use of this technique is a conditioning process in which the child associates relaxing of the bladder  sphinctre  with being woken up.

Cohort Theory views word recognition  ( for speech input )  as a bottom - up process of eliminating possible candidates by de - activation .  This is in contrast with its predecessor  ( Logogen Theory )  which assumes activation of only a single lexical item .  According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh , a set of potential word candidates ( the cohort ) is <head>activated</head> during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information . That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context ,  inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - activated .

It is often possible to identify the characteristic eggs from a faecal sample ,  but regular treatment against this and other similar parasites is usually deemed preferable .   The embryonated infective eggs or larvae of the dog roundworm ,  Toxocara canis are ingested by the dog  ( 1 )  and migrate to the body tissues  ( 2 )  such as the kidneys .  Unfortunately , the larvae usually enter the tissues of developing foetuses ( 3 ) and localise in their intestines , being <head>activated</head> by the pregnancy . After the birth of the puppies the larvae can also migrate into the puppies '  system and infect them through the mother 's  milk  ( 4 )  The worms mature passing eggs in the puppies '  faeces which are consumed by the mother and can reinfect her  ( 5 )  .  Alternatively ,  larvae which fail to establish themselves and are passed out in the faeces ,  may find another host and begin producing eggs .

Here ,  in similar territory ,  a Siberian Husky howls to attract attention from its owner .  Special collars which give a small yet painful electric shock to deter barking are permitted to be sold in some countries ,  but really have no part in training a dog properly .  There is a particular problem associated with some designs in that they are <head>activated</head> simply by the sound of barking . They do not distinguish between individual dogs ,  and so the sound of a neighbour 's  dog may cause yours to receive a punishment shock when it has not actually been barking .  Clearly ,  this is not a desirable state of affairs ,  and apart from being unfair ,  will also prove upsetting to your dog .

The refracted rays then reach the retina .  The retina consists of the inner lining at the back of the eye and is a delicate membrane ,  constructed of ten different layers ,  one of which contains the two types of light - sensitive cells ,  the rods and cones .  The rods are situated mainly in the peripheral area of the retina and they are <head>activated</head> in lower levels of lighting . The cones are receptive to colour and to higher lighting levels .  These cells are concentrated in the central area of the retina which is used in the discrimination of fine and sharp images .

Tretorn ,  in filing its complaint ,  believes that the EC Commission 's  lawyers may have missed the significance of the word in dispute  ( type )  because the LTA 's  previous ball agreement ,   ( ie the one that the EC Commission was asked to consider )  contained no written reference to pressureless tennis balls ,  therefore ensuring that it could not be party to such vital information .  So on February 6th of this year ,  while Mr Dubois was closing his file and writing to the LTA accordingly ,  Tretorn ,  having considered its position ,  went ahead with its complaint to the EC Commission. Tretorn 's action was <head>activated</head> , following correspondence in December between Tretorn 's President , Michael MacCaughey and the LTA 's National Events and Tournaments Manager , Gavin Fletcher , copies of which have come into our possession . In Fletcher 's  letter of 3rd December ,  he states ,  All professional tournaments in Britain have traditionally been played with pressurised tennis balls If Tretorn wish to bid for tournaments in this Category  ( Category A )  ,  they might assume that a bid from a company producing pressurised balls is likely to succeed .

As you will have noticed ,  the strategies we have reviewed have been operating back along the stress cycle  ( as shown in Figure 1 on page 70 )  at points nearer and nearer the source .

First the tap is turned on ( demand rises ) ; then the water gets hot ( injunctions <head>activated</head> ) ; finally stress occurs ( withdrawal , anger and tension arise ) . Our coping strategies have been listed in reverse order .  If you ca n't do anything better ,  keep mopping up.

Willard Boepple contributes an abstract sculpture , and Charles Quick , former artist - in - residence at Leeds City Art Gallery , has devised an exterior light sculpture , a minimalist Christmas decoration in the form of a vertical line of floodlights <head>activated</head> in a sequence by pedestrian traffic passing beneath it . Quietly and surprisingly ,  Thomas Gibson ,  the leading dealer in Giacometti and the modern masters ,  has been redirecting his gallery towards contemporary art .  He has opened an exhibition of twenty works on paper ,  executed in inks ,  coloured crayons and pastel ,  by Glenn Baxter  ( to 22 January 1993 )  ,  the surreal  humorist  ,  formerly represented by Nigel Greenwood ,  who derives his style and characters from the illustrations of boys '  adventure books .

Determine randomly which characters are the targets of which darts ;  no character can be a target for more than three unless he is standing right in front of the chest  ( e.g. ,  raising the lid )  .  If the chest is forced open ,  the same trap will be triggered ,  save that there 's  no chance of defusing it with the extra lock - turn .  The second chest has an identical trap , save that this time the poison in the darts is Elfbane , and it has a second trap which will be <head>activated</head> only if the chest is forcibly opened . Inside this chest is a delicate glass globe packed with Yellow Mould spores ,  and if the chest is tipped up ,  broken  into ,  etc. ,  this will release its deadly contents in a 10 - yard radius .  If the adventurers are successful in picking the lock ,  this trap wo n't be activated ,  but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere  ( no test needed ,  but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players )  .

Both had become convinced that papal jurisdiction had been wrongful ,  and now wished to make use of the supremacy to strengthen the monarchy .  Their true intentions were revealed by their promotion of the 1536 Act Extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of Rome ;  by their dissolution of the smaller monasteries ;  and by their execution of prominent opponents of their policy ,  such as Sir Thomas More ,  Bishop John Fisher ,  and the London Carthusians .  These moves convinced Pope Paul III that Henry 's disobedience was serious , and in an attempt to <head>activate</head> an earlier bull of excommunication against the king , he lent his support to the Northern rebels during the Pilgrimage of Grace . Henry 's  anti - papalism was based on the belief that the pope had wrongfully usurped the spiritual and temporal power which had traditionally belonged to the kings of England ,  and while he therefore rejected the pope 's  claim to jurisdiction in England ,  he was prepared to regard him as the rightful Bishop of Rome .  Others ,  however ,  including Cromwell and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer ,  were much more vehement in their condemnation of the papacy ;  attracted by the new ideas and reforming zeal of the continental Protestants ,  they argued that the papacy had falsified the word of  God and distorted true religion .

The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware .  For example ,  in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications ,  this is a talk through .  On the other hand , a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving to and fro between them while <head>activating</head> this and that , this is a walk through . The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator 's  point of view ;  anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around ,  manipulating controls or checking information presentations .  Ultimately ,  the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow .

With the handing over to the Council of Europe in 1960 of the social and cultural responsibilities it had inherited from the Treaty of Brussels ,  it seemed that to all intents and purposes WEU had become moribund .

Some of the information was unreliable and amounted to a considerable wastage in air dropped ordnance and flying hours by launching bombing and strafing missions over dead jungle .  Army Intelligence and Police Special Branch informant networks allowed British South East Asia Command  ( SEAC )  to implement effective tactical plans to block and hit communist bandits  transiting  through the jungle towards hard civilian and military objectives .  As the Commanding Officer of 1 Squadron was also the Senior Strike Leader at Tengah , he had the task of <head>activating</head> operations as directed by SEAC . The Lincolns played an integral part in the overall harassment of the communist offensive campaign and were effectively the only permanent heavy bomber unit in Malaya .  Bombing sorties required exceptional skill and technical accuracy on the part of the Lincoln aircrews ,  particularly the navigation plotters and bomb aimers as most bombing missions required ordnance to be dropped on an exact point as opposed to the more conventional method of carpet bombing large areas .

More accurately ,  they launched an attack on the idea that activity in the autonomic nervous system was a sufficient condition for emotional experience .  The attack was based on a number of strands of evidence ,  including the fact that activation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system was too diffuse to underpin the range of subtle emotional experiences of which we are capable ,  and the observation that severing the spinal cord in dogs does not prevent them displaying facial signs of emotion when provoked in an appropriate way .  As an alternative , Cannon proposed a centralist theory in which emotion was seen as the result of <head>activating</head> specific mechanisms in the central nervous system . However ,  his evidence did n't permit particularly precise localization within the brain .  It was n't until Papez  ( 1939 )  published his theory of emotion that the field really moved again .

It would certainly be naive just to assume that nerve cells are the same in molluscs as in people ,  but fortunately it is possible to rely on more than assumption .  The advantage of this sort of work is that the descriptions of cellular mechanisms are very detailed and this provides a good basis for determining whether the same cellular mechanisms are available in mammals .  For example , plasticity seems to depend on identifiable ion channels and catalytic molecules that <head>activate</head> or inhibit these channels . It is possible to use advanced biochemical techniques to look for comparable ion channels and catalytic units in the mammalian brain ,  without directly studying the role of cells in learning .  The problem with this approach is that it does n't allow for the possibility that there are additional cellular mechanisms of plasticity in mammals ,  that have evolved to underpin our greater learning abilities .

For example ,  loading the stomach with food or water directly has some satiating effect ,  but not as great as when the substance is also allowed to pass into the intestine or has previously passed through the mouth .  These findings raise another problem with stimulation methods , which is that the effects of stimulating at individual points in a system are only readily interpretable when the effects of <head>activating</head> separate parts of a system are additive . That is to say ,  the effects of activating two components together have to be the sum of the effects of activating either in isolation .

A further problem comes in deciding how to interpret differences in the amount of activity elicited by a set of conditions .  Does the brain use all of this information ,  or does it work on a trigger basis so that ,  once a level of activity has been exceeded ,  the actual level is irrelevant ?  For example , if a cell doubles its discharge rate under one set of conditions but quadruples under another , does that difference affect how subsequent levels in the circuit respond so that one group of cells is excited by the first set of conditions but a second group is <head>activated</head> by the second set ?

Independently of the discovery of X -  ,  Y -  ,  and W - cells came the demonstration of multiple representations of the visual field in the secondary visual cortex .  This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and , at each location , determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to <head>activate</head> single cells at that location . You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are activated by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field .  The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

The mechanism of synergy is unclear but bcl - 2  expression inhibits apoptosis ,  a property presumably pertinent to its proto - oncogenic mode of action .

Expression of Bcl - 2 completely inhibits the onset of apoptosis in serum - deprived Rat - 1 cells after c - Myc activation ,  as shown in Fig. 2 .  It is important to determine whether Bcl - 2 blocks c - Myc - induced proliferation as well as apoptosis :  the synergy between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 can easily be rationalized if Bcl - 2 blocks only the apoptotic function of c - Myc and leaves its mitogenic activity unaffected .  We examined the mitotic rate of Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER cells that were proliferating in low serum under the influence of - oestradiol - <head>activated</head> c - Myc , with and without Bcl - 2 expression . A proportion of the cells without Bcl - 2 died before undergoing division ,  as previously described ,  and thus could not be scored .  We excluded such cells from our analysis and studied 100 of the remaining cells ,  chosen at random ,  through their first divisions .

Our results demonstrate that acquisition of constitutive Bcl - 2 expression is an example of such a mutation .  Bcl - 2 mitigates the apoptotic effects of deregulated c - Myc expression without affecting its ability to promote continuous cell growth ,  so providing a mechanistic basis for the oncogenic synergy between these two proto - oncogenes .  The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 differs from the usual form of oncoprotein cooperation as observed between c - Myc and <head>activated</head> Ras in that , although c - Myc/Bcl - 2 fibroblasts proliferate continuously in the absence of mitogens , they neither appear to be morphologically transformed nor to form foci in monolayer culture ( Fig. 1 ) . The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 thus represents a novel type of oncogene cooperation ,  undetectable by classical transformation - focus assays .  Further characterization of the growth and death of cells containing various combinations of activated c -  myc ,  ras  and bcl   - 2 oncogenes should provide insights as to how the various attributes of these three classes of oncogene interact .

Consistent with this idea ,  Myc mutants with deletions of either helix - loop - helix or leucine zipper domains did not show any activity ,  though positive controls are not available for these mutants  ( data not shown )  .  The transactivation domain of Myc maps to the 177 N - terminal residues ,  consistent with the mapping of this domain in GAL4 - Myc chimaeras in mammalian cells .  The deletion mutant Myc N ( retaining residues 178 to 439 ) fails to <head>activate</head> in dimerization and in DNA - binding assays ( Fig 3 c ) , but efficiently enhances transactivation by Max - VP16 ( Fig. 2 b ) . This shows that Myc  N can dimerize with Max - VP16 and bind DNA but does not transactivate .  The Myc transactivation domain also functions in yeast when fused to heterologous DNA - binding domains  ( LexA - Myc  ( ref .  22 )  and 1235Myc - SRF ,  data not shown )  .

Bacteria adapt to the lethal effects of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide by inducing the expression of protective stress genes .  Analogous responses have been identified in human cells .  For example , haem oxygenase is a major stress protein in human cells treated with oxidants , and reactive oxygen intermediates <head>activate</head> NF - B , a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in inflammatory and acute - phase responses . We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel complementary DNA  ( CL100 )  corresponding to a messenger RNA that is highly inducible by oxidative stress and heat shock in human skin cells .  The cDNA contains an open reading frame specifying a protein of M  r  39.3K with the structural features of a non - receptor - type protein - tyrosine phosphatase and which has significant amino - acid sequence similarity to a Tyr/Ser - protein phosphatase encoded by the late gene H1  of vaccinia virus .

If we assume that the relative risk is well approximated by the odds ratio ,  the percentage of cases that could be attributable to this genotype was 8 %  in the whole population and 35 %  in the low - risk group .  The values of these estimates indicate a strong impact of the ACE/ID  polymorphism on myocardial infarction in the population .  ACE exists predominantly as an ectoenzyme of vascular endothelial cells and plays a key part in the renin - angiotensin and kallikrein - kinin systems by <head>activating</head> angiotensin I into angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin . These two peptide hormones have opposite effects on vascular tone and on smooth muscle cell proliferation ,  and as neointimal proliferation and vasospasm may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease ,  the most likely mechanism by which the ACE polymorphism affects the risk of myocardial infarction is by modulating the level of these peptides in the coronary arteries .  This hypothesis is compatible with earlier results and with a study of hypertensive patients with high renin profiles ,  a condition likely to be associated with increased angiotensin II ,  who were found to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease than those with low renin profiles .

In our system ,  we upset the pattern of tension in the epidermis by cutting so as to create a free epidermal edge .  This abolishes the component of tension acting at right angles to the cut ,  while the tangential tension remains ,  suppressing lamellipodia and provoking formation of an actin cable ,  which in turn presumably reinforces the tangential tension .  The act of wounding may also trigger an influx of Ca 2+ , <head>activating</head> contraction of the cable ; and we have in fact shown elsewhere that c - fos is rapidly induced in the epidermis at a wound margin in rat embryos . We do not know how this activated state is subsequently maintained throughout the healing process ,  although the final overrun and pile - up suggest that it takes some time to switch off .  One attractive hypothesis would be that there is positive feedback ,  whereby tension in the cable generates an intracellular chemi -  cal signal for the maintenance of tension ;  this would maintain an activated state in every cell containing a segment of the taut cable .

Here we use gene targeting to introduce a mutation in the TCR   or   genes into the germ line of mice .  Initial analysis of these mice revealed that TCR -    gene rearrangement or expression is necessary for the maintenance of normal thymocyte number and the DN to DP transition .  Our results show that a single rearranged TCR - gene introduced as a transgene can quantitatively convert DN cells to DP cells from DN cells that have accumulated in mice mutant for the recombination <head>activating</head> gene - 1 ( RAG - 1 ) and increase the total thymocyte number to the normal level . By contrast ,  TCR -    gene expression seems to be irrelevant for these developmental events .  Our study also indicates that   T cells are unnecessary for the generation of apparently normal    T cells .

Because the channel is in its low - affinity state ,  it may be positioned on the cGMP dose - response curve to be sensitive to a small decrease in free cGMP concentration ,  thus facilitating its closure .  A decrease in cytoplasmic Ca 2+  levels  ( estimated to be below 100nM )  will result because of the decreased influx of Ca 2+  through the channel .  This decrease in Ca 2+ will <head>activate</head> the guanylate cyclase , possibly through recoverin and limit phosphodiesterase activation . Calmodulin will also dissociate from the channel complex and cause the channel to switch to its high - affinity state for cGMP .  The channel will now reopen at a lower cGMP level ,  thus aiding the recovery of the ROS to its dark level as cGMP synthesis proceeds .

There is controversy over whether the carrier also transports a proton  ( or pH - changing anion )  .  Here we show that the carrier generates an alkalinization outside and an acidification inside glial cells ,  and transports anions out of the cells ,  suggesting that there is a carrier cycle in which two Na +  accompany each glutamate anion into the cell ,  while one K +  and one OH  -    ( or HCO )  are transported out .  This stoichiometry predicts a minimum Glu o of 0.6M normally ( tonically <head>activating</head> presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic NMDA receptors ) , and 370M during brain anoxia ( high enough to kill neurons ) . Transport of OH  -   /HCO on the uptake carrier generates significant pH changes ,  and may provide a mechanism for neuron - glial interaction .  Glutamate uptake was monitored electrically in salamander retinal glia ,  which have uptake like that in mammalian glia and neurons but have no glutamate - gated ion channels .

Long - term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is the primary experimental model for investigating the synaptic basis of learning and memory in vertebrates .  The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <head>activate</head> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .

When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to <head>activate</head> adequate numbers of NMDA receptors . ( It follows that there can be little activation of NMDA receptors by ambient or spontaneously released L - glutamate ,  otherwise LTP would be induced by depolarization alone .  )  Because the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation is prevented by a variety of NMDA antagonists ,  including those which act at the receptor  ( such as 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoate  ( AP5 )  )  ,  in the channel  ( for example ,  MK - 801  ( ref .  25 )  )  and at the allosteric glycine site  ( for example ,  7 - chlorokynurenic acid )  ,  it is clear that activation of these receptors is an essential trigger for the process .

There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,  indicating that kinase activity outlasts the initial induction signal .  But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate .  For example , it has been suggested that constitutively <head>activated</head> PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not.

The effect is small ,  develops gradually ,  is blocked by Ca 2+  channel antagonists ,  and requires stronger tetanic stimulation for its induction than is needed for NMDA receptor - dependent LTP .  Long - lasting potentiation can also be induced by transient exposure of hippocampal synapses to a variety of chemical agents ,  including Ca 2+166  ,  arachidonic acid ,  the metabotropic glutamate receptor  ( mGluR )  agonist aminocyclopentane - 1S,3R - dicarboxylate  ( 1S,3R - ACPD )  ,  the K +  channel blocker ,  tetraethylammonium  ( TEA )  and the G - protein activator NaF/AlCl 3  .  Chemically - induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP ( that is , saturation of one prevents induction of the other ) , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade <head>activated</head> by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor . BOX 2 The role of amino - acid receptors in the induction of LTP This e.p.s.p .  can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists ,  such as 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2,3 - dione  ( CNQX )  ,  and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor - mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors  -   amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate  ( AMPA )  .

Between 9.09.5d.p.c .  ,  these patterns becomes refined with a progressive restriction leading to the appearance of stripes of expression in r2 and r4 and a stream of crest cells migrating from each  ( Fig. 1 i '  )  .  These dynamic changes in spatial expression are identical to those observed with Hox - B1  ,  therefore the combination of Hox  genes expressed in r4  ( ref .  10 )  is reproduced in r2 upon exposure to retinoic acid .  The Hox - B1 experiments showed that a marker for r5 ( expression in neural cell bodies ) was <head>activated</head> in r3 and we wanted to examine whether there were other changes to segmental expression in r3 . We have used a line of transgenic mice that accurately reveals the normal spatial and temporal patterns of Krox - 20  expression in r3 and r5  ( Fig. 3a - e  ;  ref .  23 )  .  In initial stages ,  as reported for both Xenopus  and mouse embryos treated with retinoic acid ,  we find that although there is a clearly defined segment in the r3 position ,  the r3 stripe of Krox - 20  expression is absent .

The brooch and the bag would make it clear she had originality although ,  taken in the context of the rest of the outfit ,  not too much .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this <head>adds</head> up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no difference to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

Initially ,  an entry in a reading lexicon which matches the sequence of letters that one has detected is located .

This whole - word visual representation is then used to address and so locate its associated pronunciation in a lexicon of spoken word forms known as the speech output lexicon .

But by 1985 the sad reality had to be faced that  so far as InterCity was concerned  the market had changed ,  probably for ever .

To offset the loss of Glasgow business , extra stops were <head>added</head> to the daytime service which was revamped to serve towns such as Warrington , Wigan , Lancaster , Oxenholme and Penrith which offered greater business prospects . Only the Royal Scot  remained as a viable Euston - Glasgow train but with a schedule fifteen minutes slower than the five - hour norm established in the 1974 timetable .  At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .

Indeed ,  for a time it enabled the service to become an all HST operation so that some places actually had a better service .  There were four major East Coast developments in the 1980s :  the significant increase in HST productivity so that sets could be more extensively deployed to provide service to Inverness ,  Glasgow Queen Street ,  Hull and Cleethorpes ;  electrification of the route from Hitchin to Leeds with only minor interference to train services ;  introduction of a new track - maintenance strategy and transfer of overnight Anglo - Scottish sleeping - car services to the West Coast main line .  Although the original HST plans provided for two daily return journeys between King 's Cross and Aberdeen , by judicious programming of the sets ( plus some extra sets transferred from the Western region ) it was possible to <head>add</head> on some extra trips to existing rosters . This enabled InterCity to introduce additional HSTs to Aberdeen ,  a pair of business services to Hull and Cleethorpes and an entirely new service The Highland Chieftain  between King 's  Cross and Inverness with a journey time of seven hours .  Because of the need to refuel the two power cars ,  the practical operating range of an HST set is about 1,100 miles after which the unit must visit the depot to replenish its tanks .

The Hastings 20m scheme was celebrated by a successful Gala Day on 27 April when unlimited travel over the line for only 1 was available and more formally on 6 May when the Queen Mother  ( Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports )  travelled over the line in the Royal Train .

Steam - heated hauled stock was also eradicated ,  and the response was the reclassification of more Class 31/4s and 47/4s ,  plus the first Class 37/4s .  Longer - term planning forced BR to embark upon life - extension programmes for several locomotive types expected to be needed until well into the 1990s ,  although they were halted in 1989 before being completed .  English Electric Class 37s in particular were subjected to near - total rebuilds , involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator , regeared CP7 bogies , and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit , electric - heat generator , or ballast weights <head>added</head> to provide extra adhesion for particular freight work . Thus ,  one standard locomotive design evolved into six specialist types .  Many Brush - built Class 31s were equipped with ETH generators and given a major body overhaul ,  while some Class 47s were similarly treated .

It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,  which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .  A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can <head>add</head> interest and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example :  the swift change from the grand dvelopp   la seconde  which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque  when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's  eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake  ;  it is Odile 's  triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's  heart .  Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes <head>add</head> a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues . Classical dance patterns In classical ballet the patterns and groupings delineated by the dancers '  bodies are usually symmetrical and evenly balanced over the whole stage .

The most outstanding are Scottish ,  Italian and Spanish .  Scottish style  The Royal Danish Ballet 's  production of La Sylphide  is evidence of Bournonville 's  imaginative use of the Scot 's  quick light footwork and capers as well as the very distinctive Highland ports de bras  ,  which help the dancer to sustain balance .  To these features he <head>added</head> purely classical batterie , grands jets en avant and en attitude , cabrioles and quick glissades into chapps la seconde and swift changes of aulement . He also took care to make the patterns of his dances as interesting as in Scottish country dance .  Another example of this stereotyped Scottish style is danced by Swanhilda in Coppiia  .

Although some modern dancers do without music in the accepted sense of that term ,  they rarely do without rhythmic phrasing .  If they do they have forgotten that ,  like them ,  every member of their audience has an inborn sense of measuring time .  .  .

It is thoroughly mixed in a large vessel called a mash tun with hot pure water .  The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant <head>add</head> bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process . As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also add sugars ,  such as glucose or cereal syrup ,  to encourage a strong fermentation .  CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .

Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .  Pellets may also be stabilised by the inclusion of vitamin C  ( ascorbic acid )  to reduce oxidation .  Calcium and magnesium salts may then be <head>added</head> to partly catalyse conversion of a acids so pre - empting the boiling reactions . Losses of a  acid may be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent by these means .  Even greater efficiency of a  acid utilisation is obtained using chemical extracts of hops .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to produce bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be <head>added</head> towards the end of the boil or even afterwards . Near 100 per cent utilisation of the hop a  acid is possible by this process .  Flavours may also be separated in the hop extract and can be fractionated .

Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be produced .  Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being <head>added</head> from whole hops or , more likely , from a dirty hand . Because of the degree of processing involved ,  hop extracts are not necessarily cheaper than using whole hops .  Per unit of bitterness they are roughly as costly .

There is no such decline with extracts .  Within 30 years the brewing industry has gone from a cottage industry to high tech .  English Hops began their development of hop oils by looking at the dry hopping end of the brewing process , when a handful of whole or pellet hops are <head>added</head> to casks of beer . There can be problems of infection at this stage ,  David Gardner said .  With hop oils you can get the best from the hops ,  the essential oils and essences that can replicate the aroma and bitterness of two such disparate varieties as a Fuggle and a Golding .

Different manufacturers claim widely different life expectancies for both materials ,  but you can reasonably expect a five - year life from most types  ( but as some manufacturers claim a life of only half this ,  and others double ,  check before you buy )  .  The majority of bird netting is likely to be knotted  ( this produces a fine and very flexible net )  or knitted ,  but the thickness of the thread is likely to be more important than the type of assembly .

The result is a townscape of terrible despairing cries which mean ,  and mean more than ,  that the drunks are leaving the pubs between two and three o'clock in the morning ,  the pubs that reek of alcohol and cucumber and fish .  A townscape of nightmare yellows :  sky ,  buildings ,  furniture ,  wallpaper ,  faces  the colour of age ,  heat ,  pestilence ,  bile and jaundice ,  bruisings and stainings ,  with a stronger connotation of dirt in Russian than in English ;  the colour of the tickets of identification which prostitutes were required to carry ;  the colour of Raskolnikov 's  cubbyhole of a room ;  and the colour which greets him when he comes to after fainting at the police station and sees a man holding a yellow glass filled with yellow water .  Looking over Dostoevsky 's shoulder , we find him first writing small yellow glass , then deleting small ; and writing water then <head>adding</head> yellow warm to the water , then deleting warm the final text uniting an apocalyptic starkness of yellow meets yellow with the topicality of Petersburg 's notoriously filthy water supply , a subject of much comment and complaint in the newspapers . At such moments we come  as close as it is possible to get to the spirit of Crime and Punishment  .  Having ,  as I say ,  abandoned everything he had done ,  he sat down and wrote a six - part novel within a year which included a twenty - six day break in which he threw together and dictated The Gambler  ,  itself not a small book nor a negligible one ,  to satisfy the terms of a contract he had made with a shyster publisher .

Compare Dostoevsky 's  attempt ,  frustrated by the good angel of his genius ,  to explain Raskolnikov 's  motive for his crime .  In the novel itself ,  where we might expect Marmeladov to speak of solace ,  respite ,  forgetting ,  companionship ,  he grasps the paradox that he drinks because he is in search of suffering ,  of tears and tribulation .  And , he <head>adds</head> , I have found them . This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .  Moreover ,  as always in Dostoevsky ,  the search for suffering refuses to settle into coherent masochistic focus .

The one is the passive and the other the active form of a single human truth ,  as Dostoevsky sees it and realizes it fictionally .  The singleness of this truth is what I called the marriage of the Drunks  project and the Confession project in Crime and Punishment  .  The novelist is now of course in middle age , but right back in his teens he wrote to his brother Man is a mystery , <head>adding</head> that a lifetime spent trying to unravel the mystery would not be wasted .

If we take wanting everybody to look at him as the real reason ,  then the case of Stavrogin is  ( in the lawyer 's  phrase )  on all fours with that of the underground man 's  indecent exposure of consciousness .  However ,  I invite nobody into my soul he declares ,  as if to banish the exhibitionist thought.44 And then if the search for suffering is allowed to eclipse the rest ,  we are back with Marmeladov squinnying into the bottom of his vodka jug ;  whereas Stavrogin saying he wants to forgive himself might be Raskolnikov pondering retrospectively ,  selfcritically ,  on his admission of guilt at the police station .  To Marmeladov , Raskolnikov , and the underground man , I now <head>add</head> Svidrigailov , because the chief enormity which is being confessed , or merely admitted to , or flaunted , or feigned , binds Stavrogin to the America - minded debauchee no less tightly than does the boredom theme of the At Tikhon 's chapter . As with the highly misleading phrase Stavrogin 's  Confession ,  critics and commentators behave as if they had got into a huddle .

Laser beams consist of photons which ,  though small by atomic standards ,  have a cumulative inertial effect ,  Dr Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado ,  who heads one research group ,  says that cooling an atom with a laser beam is like trying to slow down movement of a heavy object by bombarding it with ping - pong balls .  In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ;  the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms .  Otherwise the effect is to <head>add</head> heat energy rather than remove it . What Wieman has done  as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record  is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .  Not only has the essential large vacuum cell been reduced to a small glass cell ,  but Wieman has also been able to replace gas lasers with solid state devices .

Traffic message control  ( TMC )  ,  under development as one of the European Drive projects ,  may bring RDS a little nearer to Carfax .  This is seen as using RDS as a data channel of very limited capacity in conjunction with a speech synthesis chip or possibly some form of printer in the car  ( it could provide automatic translation when travelling abroad )  as a means of sending traffic telegrams to cars without interrupting the radio programmes .  But TMC seems bound to <head>add</head> much extra intricacy to the already complicated RDS receiver . D Kopitz  ( EBU )  in discussing  development of TMC admits that :  The TMC device will probably be too complex to permit its incorporation within a standard car radio case .  It will also require it own RF tuner  ( VHF )  to permit the car radio listener a free choice of listening entertainment ,  without obligation to tune to the particular programme service which carries TMC information .

A key text is his early essay ,  Structure ,  Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences ,  which concludes that there are two possible interpretations of interpretation :  The one seeks to decipher ,  dreams of deciphering a truth or an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign ,  and which lives the necessity of interpretation as an exile .  The other ,  which is no longer turned toward the origin ,  affirms play and tries to pass beyond man and humanism . Derrida says that these two interpretations are absolutely irreconcilable , even though , he <head>adds</head> in his gnomic fashion , we reconcile them in an obscure economy . It is his second interpretation ,  deriving substantially from Nietzsche ,  that has become dominant in deconstruction as popularly understood ,  where all meaning is turned into play .  And it is this approach which leads to denunciation of Derrida as a  nihilist ;  in Frederick Crews 's  words ,  an intellectual nihilist ,  though a learned and exuberant one .

The publicity his ideas have attracted has only deepened the tragedy : the bad influence of those he has himself influenced has <head>added</head> frivolity to the obscurity Derrida 's  admirers ,  and perhaps some disinterested observers ,  would reject such charges as based on misunderstandings of his work .

Having taught English Literature for a long time in universities , on both sides of the Atlantic , and having spent some years pondering the questions raised in this book , I have come to some very tentative conclusions about what might be done ; they are not , I might <head>add</head> , of the kind I thought I would come to when I began working on it . In the wake of the MacCabe affair in 1981 ,  an editorial in the Times Higher Education Supplement  said that a fissiparous discipline such as English had a number of hard choices in front of it :  it could become even more pluralistic and diffuse ,  with accompanying pedagogic problems ;  it could repressively impose one favoured approach ;  or it could split .  Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .

But in every age there have been poets who were uninterested in thus cutting their poems free of any but a linguistic reality ,  poets who are realistic and mimetic in the most straightforward senses of those two complicated words .  In our age Pound ,  far more than Eliot or Yeats ,  is such a poet .  And yet we have seen that the topography of Sligo ( to which one should <head>add</head> the topography of at least one part of London , Bedford Park ) is illuminating for the reader of Yeats . And who is to say that the topography of the Somerset village of East Coker is unimportant to a reading of Eliot 's  four Quartets  ?  And yet how few of us have made that pilgrimage !

The poem ,  we might say ,  is in two minds about itself and its own meaning .   But that is not the whole story .  For Pound undoubtedly made the poem more obscure by asking for the excision of some transitional and bridging passages where the language was not at full pressure , but on the other hand he caused to be removed some extended sections which , being plainly extraneous , could only have <head>added</head> to readers ' bafflement . Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot .  As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear ,  he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense ,  one who was concerned for public life ,  and believed  ( like activists of the Left )  that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ;  whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's  political pronouncements ,  even when he was most engag  as editor of True Criterion  ,  revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .

In particular , the green <head>argument</head> advanced by environmentalists , fanned by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 Euro - elections , suggested that the message of Thatcherite consumption and wealth creation failed to mesh with wider concerns for the quality of life . The rise of green issues ,  indeed ,  was more naturally appealing to Labour or Alliance politicians ,  and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to Thatcherism that British society could release .  It led to Nicholas Ridley 's  removal from the Environment department in July 1989 ,  in favour of the notoriously wet Chris Patten .
